Doom backup script
==================
Bethesda's new Doom game is pretty sweet, except when it crashes on you and you have to start the game over due to save file corruption. Oh yeah, they don't create any backups for you either. Hence the point of this script--back up your save file manually so that when the shit hits the fan, you can copy back your save data and resume. Shame on you, Bethesda.
